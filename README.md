## Notes

* At which point should we start deleting tweets/data from out local db? Daily, 
After a number has exceeded?
* I don't know how to return the tweet object in offline mode while making sure 
the tweet posts when the user is back online. Any suggestions? 
* How can we change the color of the action bar items? I ended up just replacing the "up arrow" with a png. 
* I didn't quite follow the next reach up pattern in Adapter on click listener, it's calling the ProfileActivity.class. What would have been the better approach?
